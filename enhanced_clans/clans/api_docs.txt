A little to know about me and my coding:
I'm by no means a professional coder, and as such this code isn't
great. That being said, it all should work as intended. It's all 
still under development.

Local playercs.
Playercs is = to the player name + "-clan".
Playercs is a common variable that has been put in for easier and better access to clan storage.

Local level.
Level is = player name and "-level"
"-Level" is = to the number of people killed(killer) - number of how many times they have died(victim), or total sum of the two variables(killer - victim = level).
Level is an important peice of the sorting alg, it is the divider.



Alright, the cool stuff:
tables:
    clansmod.clans
        --- The avaliable clans, by default
    end
end

functions:
    clansmod.add_to_clan(issuer<string>, playername<string>, random<bool>, clan<optional,string>)
        --- Sets a player to a clan, if one isn't given
        --- its randomly selected from clansmod.clans
    clansmod.remove_from_clan


playername is = to the player name + the clan of the player.
All this is is playercs a local that has been put in for easier and better access to the player and clan at the same time.
