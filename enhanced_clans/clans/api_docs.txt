A little to know about me and my coding:
I'm by no means a professional coder, and as such this code isn't
great. That being said, it all should work as intended. It's all 
still under development.

Alright, the cool stuff:
tables:
    clansmod.clans
        --- The avaliable clans, by default
    end
end

functions:
    clansmod.add_to_clan(issuer<string>, playername<string>, random<bool>, clan<optional,string>)
        --- Sets a player to a clan, if one isn't given
        --- its randomly selected from clansmod.clans
    clansmod.remove_from_clan
